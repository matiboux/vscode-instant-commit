# Instant Commit extension for VS Code

Instant commit your changes with a single click, auto generating a commit message for you.


## How to use the extension?

With the extension installed and enabled, in the source control tab, you can instant commit your changes by right-cliking and selecting "Instant Commit" on:
- Individual files (one or more selected files)
- Individual folders (one or more selected folders)
- Source control groups

Only Git is officially supported for now as source control.
